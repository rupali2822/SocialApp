 Completed Features

Authentication: Login and Signup screens using local DataStore for storing user credentials and login state.

Dashboard & Feed: Feed fragment with SemiCircularNavView for navigation and dynamic UI updates.

Profile Fragment: UI design with logout functionality.

UI State Management: Maintains login state, bottom navigation selection, and handles device rotations using ViewModel.

Navigation: Clicking the profile icon in Feed opens the Profile fragment. Navigation visibility and selected item updates are handled dynamically.

Improvements with More Time

1.Complete remaining UI designs and implement all intended functionality.

2.Thorough testing of UI state, including rotation and bottom navigation selection.

3.Enhance error handling and improve UX with input validation and smoother interactions.

  While achieving the completed features, I focused on maintaining a robust and consistent UI state, ensuring a polished experience. It requires time, but I aimed to do it as perfectly as possible.
